# efficient_nutrition

Helped out a friend with his student project, which was a business idea of a nutrition tracker. 
This is a POC which shows how an application that uses pictures taken with a smartphone can use machine learning to recognise the dish and derive nutritional values based on the recognised dish.
This application used machine learning to recognise some simple dishes like hamburger, french fries, etc. to show the potensial value of being able to automatically derive nutritional values based on a picture taken with your phone.
